# Vue 3 Starer Project

As Vue 3 beta just came out, its final release is around the corner. Many people, including me, are eager to know what has changed and how to create project with it

## What does it include

### [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next)

This should go without saying ðŸ˜‚

### [Vuex 4](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/tree/4.0)

The team has just finished upgrading it to Vue 3 and the APIs stay the same. However they are some plans for future APIs so there may be breaking changes later on.

### [Vue Router 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next)

The codebase has been upgraded to use Vue 3 and most of the existing functions are usable.
